                This challenge is to create some kind of verification for my portfolio contact page located â†’ <a href="https://michalmacko.com/contact.html" target="_blank">https://michalmacko.com/contact.html</a> When i first created the contact page i thought that after some time, one or two bots may find their to spam my email lol. But.. after half a year i can tell that i was totally mistaken and did take this very lightly. I am having constant flow of bots using this contact form and sending me garbage spams. I wonder how they find my contact page and send me the message lol. Either way, its time to make some justification against them.
