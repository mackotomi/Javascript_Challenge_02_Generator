Part 02
Checking what the user types into field, where the regenerated code from part 01 must match.
*/

// This part will include checking if the input is not empty and that there is really 10 characters.
// If there is 10 characters, check the characters and compare them to the keyInstance.
// If the characters are equal, green outline the input, othewise make it red. This is for UX to singalize the user right or wrong idea.
// If the character are equal, allows to use the send button.
// If less then 10 characters, disable the send button.

    console.log(keyUserInput.value);
    // We need to make logic that when 10 keys is typed in, store them in a variable and compare it to the regenerated instance that is always stored in the keyInstance variable.
    // We compare two variables content if they are equal;
    // If they are equal, we enable the send button that is stored in variable sendButton
    // We also check if the characters count is 10, otherwise we will disable the button.

// Challenge finished after 7 days.
// Honestly, i cant believe i was able to finish it, im really proud of myself, pat pat lol.
// It may be considered as an easy project, but it was not..

/*
Summary: 
I was able to solve this challenge using code, that is so cool-cool-cool :]. 
Finally, i have something to show when i will try to apply for front end developer jobs, where js is required.
Lastly, i have learned new things and gained some ++ experience to coding and javascript in general.
And good job buddy, moving on to next challenges.
Note: i did not used any GPT code, occasionally i asked how you can to get an idea and from there, i would try to solve with coding it myself.
